## Technical Overview

The Honeywell HTRAM device uses a proprietary BLE protocol. While it broadcasts standard GATT services, real-time sensor data is retrieved through a specific Request-Response (Polling) mechanism on a custom service.

### BLE GATT Configuration
*   **Service (Custom):** `fc247940-6e08-11e4-80fc-0002a5d5c51b`
*   **Write Characteristic (Commands):** `3d115840-6e0b-11e4-b24f-0002a5d5c51b`
*   **Notify Characteristic (Data Stream):** `f833d6c0-6e0b-11e4-9136-0002a5d5c51b`

### Protocol & Hardware Documentation
> **Note:** For advanced details, please refer to:
> - [**Protocol Reference**](PROTOCOL.md): Details on Firmware Updates and WiFi/Zigbee commands.
> - [**Hardware Analysis**](HARDWARE.md): Insights into MCU, SPI Flash, and PCB structure.

#### 1. Initialization
The device typically expects an initialization command to set the BLE mode upon connection.
*   **Command:** `7b 41 00 0c 74 58 01 01 00 4e 08 7d`

#### 2. Requesting Data
The device does not stream data automatically by default. To receive updates, the client must poll the device by writing to the **Write Characteristic**.
*   **Real-time Data Request:** `7b 41 00 07 40 44 02 00 fc 3e 7d`

#### 3. Response Format (Header: `0x4144`)
| Offset | Length | Description | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 7-8 | 2 bytes | CO2 Concentration | Big-Endian (ppm) |
| 9 | 1 byte | Temperature | Signed Integer (°C) |
| 10 | 1 byte | Humidity | Integer (%) |
| 11 | 1 byte | Battery Level | Index (0=Empty, 4=Full) |
| 12 | 1 byte | Charging Status | Boolean (1=Yes, 0=No) |

The Python script is ideal for **24/7 logging**, **home automation integration**, and running as a **background service**.

### Installation & Setup

#### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd honeywell-htram-v1w-ble-monitor

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install bleak
```

#### Step 2: Pair Your Device (First Time Only)
1. **Enable pairing mode** on your Honeywell sensor:
   - Double-press the top button until the Bluetooth icon starts **flashing**
2. **Pair via your OS Bluetooth settings** (not required on all systems, but recommended):
   - macOS: System Settings → Bluetooth → Connect to "HTRAM-..."
   - Windows: Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Add device
   - Default PIN (if prompted): `000000` or `123456`

```
- Targets a specific sensor (useful for multi-device setups)
- Polls every 10 seconds instead of default 5

#### 5. Fetch History + Continue Monitoring
```bash
python air_monitor.py --history --dashboard
```
- Downloads history first
- Then switches to live dashboard mode
- Useful for initial data collection + ongoing monitoring

### Advanced Features

#### 🕒 Automatic Time Synchronization
- **Why it matters:** The device has no built-in real-time clock (RTC)
- **What it does:** Sets the device's internal time to your system's UTC time on every connection
- **Impact:** Ensures all future historical records have accurate timestamps
- **When it happens:** Automatically after connecting, before any data requests

#### 📜 90-Day History Storage
- **Capacity:** Device stores approximately 90 days of measurements (1-minute intervals)
- **Persistence:** Reading history does NOT delete it from the device
- **Format:** Each record contains: Unix Timestamp, CO2, Temperature, Humidity
- **Retrieval:** Non-destructive block-based download (128 bytes per block)

#### 🔄 Auto-Reconnection
- **Behavior:** If Bluetooth connection drops, script automatically retries every 10 seconds
- **Use case:** Long-term monitoring in environments with occasional interference
- **Status:** Connection errors are logged but don't crash the script

#### 📁 Daily Log Rotation
- **File naming:** `air_log_[MAC]_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
- **Rotation:** New file created at midnight (local time)
- **Headers:** Automatically added to new files
- **Location:** Same directory as the script

---

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** `No HTRAM devices found`
- **Solution:** Ensure device is in pairing mode (Bluetooth icon flashing). Double-press top button.

**Problem:** `Connection error: Bluetooth device is turned off`
- **Solution:** Enable Bluetooth on your computer. On macOS: System Settings → Bluetooth.

**Problem:** `Permission denied` or `Access denied`
- **Solution:** On Linux, add your user to the `bluetooth` group: `sudo usermod -a -G bluetooth $USER`

**Problem:** History download shows old/incorrect dates
- **Solution:** This is normal if the device was never time-synced before. Future records will be accurate after the first sync.

## 📱 Extended PWA & Native Android Resident Monitor

This fork extends the original HTRAM project with a configurable PWA alarm system and a native Android application designed for reliable background monitoring.

### PWA additions

The Web Bluetooth dashboard now includes:

- Installable **Progressive Web App (PWA)** support with a manifest and service worker.
- Configurable local CO₂ warning and alarm thresholds.
- Alarm delay and repeat interval.
- Optional sound and vibration.
- Silence/re-arm controls.
- Ready-made profiles: **Home**, **Udo awake**, **Udo sleeping**, and **Custom**.
- Alarm settings persisted locally in the browser.

> Web Bluetooth is still subject to browser/background limitations. For monitoring with the phone screen off, use the native Android app below.

### Native Android app

A native Android implementation lives in the `android/` directory. It communicates directly with the HTRAM over BLE and runs a foreground service so monitoring can continue while the screen is off.

Current native features include:

- Live **CO₂, temperature, humidity and battery** readings.
- Resident foreground BLE monitoring with automatic reconnection.
- Persistent Android monitoring notification.
- Configurable CO₂ warning/alarm thresholds, delay and repeat interval.
- **Home**, **Udo awake**, **Udo sleeping**, and **Custom** alarm profiles.
- Optional alarm sound and vibration.
- Silence/re-arm support.
- High-CO₂ notifications that open the app directly on the Monitor tab.
- Separate **low-battery warning** when the HTRAM reports battery level **1/4 or 0/4**. The warning is issued once and rearms after the battery rises above that level.
- Last sensor reading stored locally so the dashboard can display it immediately when reopened.
- Android system-bar/window-inset handling so the interface does not overlap the status bar.

The native UI is split into three tabs:

1. **MONITOR** — PWA-style live dashboard and alarm configuration.
2. **SERVICE / LOG** — foreground-service controls plus a persistent diagnostic console. The log can be manually scrolled, its text selected/copied, cleared, or returned to auto-follow mode.
3. **HELP** — app/version information, device and operation description, repository link, and acknowledgement of the original reverse-engineering project.

### Android permissions and operation

On current Android versions the app requests the Bluetooth Nearby Devices permissions and notification permission required for resident monitoring. The app scans for the HTRAM, establishes the custom GATT connection, enables notifications and polls the sensor periodically.

Alarm evaluation is performed **locally on the Android phone**. The app does not require a Honeywell account or Honeywell cloud service, and the configurable app alarm thresholds do **not** rewrite the HTRAM's own sensor/alarm parameters.

### Building the Android APK

GitHub Actions contains an **Android APK** workflow that builds the debug APK whenever relevant Android files are changed. The same build can be produced locally from the `android/` directory with Gradle:

```bash
cd android
gradle assembleDebug
```

The resulting APK is located at:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Project acknowledgement

The Android implementation and the additions in this fork build on the BLE protocol reverse-engineering and Web Bluetooth work of **noname122021**:

- Original project: https://github.com/noname122021/honeywell-htram-v1w-ble-monitor
- This extended fork: https://github.com/tupolev/honeywell-htram-v1w-ble-monitor

The original project's protocol research made the independent PWA and native Android extensions possible.
